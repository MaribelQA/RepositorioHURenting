# Test Case Creation Principles

## 📌 Objective

Generate high-quality, structured, and comprehensive test cases that ensure full validation of system behavior, covering functional correctness, edge cases, and failure scenarios.

---

## 🧠 General Principles

* Each test case must validate ONLY ONE behavior
* Test cases must be atomic, independent, and reusable
* Avoid redundancy while ensuring full coverage
* Use clear, precise, and unambiguous language
* Focus on user behavior and system response
* Ensure test cases are reproducible

---

## 🎯 Coverage Requirements

For every requirement, ALWAYS include:

### ✅ Positive Scenarios

* Valid inputs
* Expected user flows
* Standard system behavior

### ❌ Negative Scenarios

* Invalid inputs
* Incorrect credentials
* Missing required fields
* Unauthorized access

### ⚠️ Edge Cases

* Boundary values
* Empty inputs
* Maximum/minimum limits
* Unexpected user behavior

## 🔍 Test Design Techniques

Apply the following techniques when relevant:

* Equivalence Partitioning
* Boundary Value Analysis
* Decision Table Testing
* State Transition Testing
* Error Guessing

---

## 🧩 Test Case Structure Rules

* Follow the provided template STRICTLY
* Do not skip any sections
* Maintain consistent naming for Test Case IDs
* Titles must clearly describe:

  * Action
  * Expected result
  * Condition

---

## 🔢 Test Steps Rules

* MUST be written as a table with:
  Step | Action | Expected Result
* Each step must represent a single user/system action
* Each step must include a clearly verifiable expected result
* Steps must be logically ordered
* Avoid combining multiple actions in one step

---

## 📊 Test Data Guidelines

* Use realistic and meaningful data
* Clearly define inputs and expected outputs
* Include valid and invalid data sets where applicable

---

## 🔀 Test Classification

Each test case must include:

* Test Type:

  * Functional
  * Negative
  * Edge
  * Regression
  * Smoke

* Priority:

  * High → Critical functionality
  * Medium → Important but not critical
  * Low → Minor scenarios

---

## 🌍 Environment Awareness

* Assume execution in QA or Staging unless specified
* Consider environment dependencies when relevant

---

## 🚫 What to Avoid

* Vague or generic test cases
* Missing expected results
* Multiple validations in one test case
* Ambiguous steps
* Repetitive or duplicate scenarios

---

## 🧪 Quality Criteria Checklist

Each test case MUST:

* Be clear and easy to understand
* Be executable without additional clarification
* Have deterministic expected results
* Be independent from other test cases
* Provide value in defect detection

---

## ⚡ Output Requirements

* Output MUST follow the test-case-template.md strictly
* Output MUST be in Spanish
* Maintain consistent formatting (Markdown)
* Ensure readability and professional structure
